# CS 3 Reflections_CELIS

## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.

1. **Building your HTML website** - For this specific topic I attended LEAP or an advanced class for CS 3. As I took class after class, I became more interested in this and was able to grasp the basic needs. Also as someone whos father works in software engineering, he helped me understand HTML and CSS more in simpler terms.
2. **Conditions** - In FYP, Both in Python and C++, this topic was discussed. This came as more of a refresher for me in JS.
3. **Operations** - At first, this topic had me a bit confused. Since JavaScript didn't really have a strict code like C++, I was lost. Though eventually, with time, I started to understand more about how this works.
4. **Variable Declaration** - Was discussed in Grade 8, in C++. This was basically a recall just with more information since we were now using JS which was more flexible than the previous coding language.
5. **Input and Output** - This topic was one of my favorites actually! I liked seeing the process of how JS processes inputs and outputs (I also just like putting buttons in my HTML aha).

## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.

1. **Loops** - If I'll be honest, I never really mastered this topic that well during Grade 8. I tried my best to understand it but I only understood its *concept* and not much of how I can do it for application purposes.
2. **Debugging** - This was not really taught to us but it is one of the activities we took part in. I would say that I really dislike debugging since sometimes theres very small operators you need to add to improve the code more.
3. **Switch Case** - Not really that hard of a topic, but it does confuse me sometimes, so I need to practice more. I often forget how to format switch-cases and it marks my code as wrong.
4. **Declaration of Functions** - It's not necessarily *that* challenging, but I do need to understand it more. In some scenarios I often don't know how to apply it on my code and it takes a few minutes for me to find out how I will work it. In time pressured circumstances, long ang extended thinking is not very helpful.
5. **Event Handlers** - This confused me a bit since it was not discussed, but could also make activities easier to build/make. I will try my best to understand this topic better though.

## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.



## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

### Effective Activities
1. **Input and Outputs** - Compared to what I advanced at in the summer, this had more information and helped me understand it more than how it was discussed to me back then. My favorite activity honestly! This also helped me a lot since I sometimes have passion projects and most of my visions included inputting values. Most likely in the future, this would be used many times.
2. **Conditions** - Also one of my favortie topics! This was really fun to learn and would help me a lot in my passion projects. This topic had more association with Input and Outputs which helped me in understanding their connections.

### Activities that were less effective
1. **Debugging** - This one activity could help a lot whenever we have projects, though it felt a bit sudden. I'm pretty sure that debugging should be familiar with multiple people since the gist is to just fix the code up a bit for it to work but not much was given for this activity (I also want to request for tips when it comes to debugging plzz).
2. **JS Functions (Event handlers)** - This one was not discussed in class. Although, the activities do need this particular subtopic in functions for it to be easier for me and maybe other people.
